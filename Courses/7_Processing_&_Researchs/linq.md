## **What is LINQ ?**
**Linq** for **L**anguage **In**tegrated **Q**uery. As its name says, that's an integrated language that helps doing requests on
collections of data.

Linq uses a vocabulary similar to SQL and you'll find many words in common, such as `select`, `from`, `where`, etc. Making it really interesting if you have some basics knowledge of database development.

        It takes a data source, such as a collection and by using a query made by Linq, you will filter it and only select the datas interesting for you. 
        <br>
        Then with a foreach loop, you can iterate on the result and make specific actions on the filtered elements.
